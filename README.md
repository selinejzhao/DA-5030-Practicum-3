# DA-5030-Practicum-3


What's left: 
- Try out 2 different k values based on geography and plant family/order
- Make an elbow plot for k values 
- visualize clusterst
- think through Hamming distance (possibly another package)

UPDATE 11/28:
- all above finished, some confusion
- cluster using k = 8  and k = 10 should be fine
- would like extra attention on the k value based on plant family section (some comments included within code)
- visualization needs major help, it looks completely wrong when i run it (all packages downloaded, dont know what's the problem)
- not sure if the elbow plot will be affected by the fact that i included two other cluster columns in the plants dataframe
- references/links to maps added at the end (not ieee format)
